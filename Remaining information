Remaining Tidbits

Requirements I neglected to complete/bugs identified:
1. This was supposed to show multiple months if it spilled over to the next month which it isn't doing
2. In the images, it has a calendar with only 3 weeks, but mine always shows the whole month
3. If the whole week has blank days, I neglected to include a min height so the table cells don't collapse
4. It seems that some of the API responses are a bit off, I've noticed with January in its response it isn't quite showing the right responses

If I had more time:
1. I would have used customized fonts/matched the fonts in the screenshots
2. I would have styled the page more, it's very bare but I didn't have ideas on how to style it so I left it as is
3. I would have liked to list the holidays beneath the calendar for more information with their names
4. I would have added the hover label
5. I also don't like how few error states I've included, I would have more validations, and more descriptive error states
6. I also don't love how I've organized my code, I'm used to working within a larger codebase and adhering to a variety of coding standards so I was just sort of throwing this together. But I'd want to have a better infrastructure
